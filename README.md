Deepface is licensed under the MIT License - see [`LICENSE`](https://github.com/serengil/deepface/blob/master/LICENSE) for more details. However, the library wraps some external face recognition models: [VGG-Face](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/vgg_face/), [Facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/LICENSE.md), [OpenFace](https://github.com/iwantooxxoox/Keras-OpenFace/blob/master/LICENSE), [DeepFace](https://github.com/swghosh/DeepFace), [DeepID](https://github.com/Ruoyiran/DeepID/blob/master/LICENSE.md), [ArcFace](https://github.com/leondgarse/Keras_insightface/blob/master/LICENSE), [Dlib](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/blob/master/dlib/LICENSE.txt), and [SFace](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_zoo/blob/master/models/face_recognition_sface/LICENSE). Besides, age, gender and race / ethnicity models are based on VGG-Face. Licence types will be inherited if you are going to use those models. Please check the license types of those models for production purposes.
